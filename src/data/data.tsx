  description: `I am a passionate and driven individual with a keen interest in leveraging technology to solve real-world problems! My educational background includes an M.Sc. in Machine Learning and a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering. My master's thesis is about clustering of Alzheimer's disease data to identify subtypes of Alzheimer's using FDG-PET scans. This research was conducted in collaboration with Karolinska Institutet.
During my bachelor's degree, I had the opportunity to work with different projects, such as building a Qi receiver for wireless charging and using Machine Learning to predict the accuracy of Nanopore DNA sampling.  Additionally, I have gained work experience through internships, including working as a software engineer at Goldman Sachs, working with R&D of Electric Vehicles at Scania, and working with R&D of high-voltage industrial appliances at Hitachi Energy`,
